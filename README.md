[![build](https://github.com/t0nero/DuelsCombo/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/t0nero/DuelsCombo/actions/workflows/maven.yml) [![test](https://github.com/t0nero/DuelsCombo/actions/workflows/maven_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/t0nero/DuelsCombo/actions/workflows/maven_tests.yml)


Adds a combo duel to Realizedd's Duels plugin, and custom items such as autofire bows and grappling hook bows.

Note: this plugin is not a Duels extension, and it has to be dropped in the regular `/plugins` directory instead of `plugins/Duels/extensions/`.

Documentation is available [here](https://github.com/t0nero/DuelsCombo/blob/master/docs/).
